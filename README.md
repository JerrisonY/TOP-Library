# TOP-Library
The Odin Project - Library Project

Checklist:
- darkmode button, this will change font colors and background color
- Decide on book cards or book list (hover effect if list)
- plus button with hover effect and add books 

FINISHED PROJECT: 
Things to note for future:
- Light mode not working because can't grab the original variables within the scope
- Deleting cards doesn't truly work as they get regenerated on adding a new card when page gets refresh (because we are just deleting the card and not the object from array)
